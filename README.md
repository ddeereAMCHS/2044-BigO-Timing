# Timing

## Due: DoW MM/DD at 11:59 PM

- Open the file called `Timing.java`
- Each algorithm has a text file listing the sizes you should use for that algorithm
- Create an array of that size
- For each algorithm, you will do the following 10 times for each size:
  - Use the Random class to generate random integers to fill that array
    - I have given this code to you
  - For the search algorithms, generate a random integer to search for
  - For the binary search algorithm, sort the array before you start timing
  - Time the algorithm
  - Print how long it takes the algorithm to run
- Enter the values into a spreadsheet
- In the spreadsheet:
  - Calculate the average time for each input size
  - Determine the time complexity of the algorithm
    - To do this, you will need to graph input size on the x-axis and time (or some modification of it) on the y-axis

You will not turn in any code for this assignment, only the spreadsheet\
\
The file `Util.java` will contain the code for the algorithms
