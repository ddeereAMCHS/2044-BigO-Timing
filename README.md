# Timing

- Create a program called `Timing.java`
- Prompt the user for a number
- Create an array of that size
- For each of the 10 trials:
  - Use the Random class to generate random integers to fill that array
  - For the search algorithms, generate a random integer to search for
  - For the binary search algorithm, sort the array
  - Time the algorithm
  - Print how long it takes the algorithm to run
- Enter the values into a spreadsheet
- In the spreadsheet:
  - Calculate the average time for each input size
  - Determine the time complexity of the algorithm
    - To do this, you will need to graph input size on the x-axis and time (or some modification of it) on the y-axis

Use the following input sizes:\
100\
1000\
10000\
100000\
1000000\
\
The file `Util.java` will contain the code for the algorithms
